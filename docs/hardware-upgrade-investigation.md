# Intel RealSense
The most interesting candidate for the depth camera upgrade is [Intel RealSense D435](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d435/). It has a good depth sensor range up to 10m and quite impressive performance 90FPS with resolution 848x480 [specs](https://www.mouser.com/pdfdocs/Intel_D400_Series_Datasheet.pdf). Also it might optionally synchronise RGB and Depth streams.
The following chart shows depth sensor error depending on a distance: [Depth error](https://forums.intel.com/s/question/0D70P0000068rTmSAI/fluctuating-and-unstable-depth-stream-from-intel-real-sense-d435?language=en_US#559606). For ex. for 3 meters the depth error is 35mm which is acceptable.

**Pros:**
A good performance and affordable price. A big community and a big company behind.

**Cons:** 
Not detected yet.

**Price: $179**

# Kinect V2
